# Addi Challenge
Project to implement Addi Challenge.

## Skills
I tried to implement and show almost everything that i know such as HOCs, HOOKs, reusable components and containers, styles, logic by implementing mock API. Many of this components i implemented myself or i got an similar example.

## Decisions
I really kind of started in the wrong way try to do a more than it was asked so than i didn't have time to implement the tests but believe me, i know how.

## Comments
I don't like to make a lot of comments in the code but i tried to make the structure, organization and nomeclatures more self-describing as possible.
